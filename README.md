## What is Next.js ?

Next.js is JavaScript framework that enables you to build **_superfast_** and extremly **_user-friendly static websites_**, as well as **_web applications_** using **_React_**.

This framework allows us to build **_hybrid applications_** that contain both **_server-rendered and statically_** generated pages.

It can be perfectly combined with **_headless_** CMSes, or **_eCommerce_** platforms to drive extraordinary **_performance_** and **_SEO_** results.

React.js is one of the leading frameworks used when creating web applications. It enables developers to create SEO-friendly and highly-interactive components. React.js features also boost maintenance and overall productivity. The integration of the Material UI library in React.js projects takes things to a new level.
