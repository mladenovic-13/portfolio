## What is Next.js ?

Next.js is JavaScript framework that enables you to build **_superfast_** and extremly **_user-friendly static websites_**, as well as **_web applications_** using **_React_**.

This framework allows us to build **_hybrid applications_** that contain both **_server-rendered and statically_** generated pages.

It can be perfectly combined with **_headless_** CMSes, or **_eCommerce_** platforms to drive extraordinary **_performance_** and **_SEO_** results.
